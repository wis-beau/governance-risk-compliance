# Governance and Compliance Frameworks

This module explores **governance structures and compliance frameworks** that organizations adopt to align security with business goals.  
We will focus on **ISO 27001** and the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, comparing their key components and highlighting how they apply to our SaaS startup `xxxx`.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain why governance is critical to cybersecurity and business success.  
- Describe the purpose and scope of **ISO 27001** and **NIST CSF**.  
- Compare the similarities and differences between ISO 27001 and NIST CSF.  
- Build a simple **business case** for adopting a framework in a startup environment.  

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts Covered
- **Governance**: Leadership, accountability, and policy enforcement.  
- **Compliance Frameworks**:  
  - ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management System – ISMS).  
  - NIST CSF (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).  
- **Framework Comparison**: Control-based vs. function-based approaches.  
- **Business Case**: Why SaaS startups often pursue ISO 27001 or SOC 2 to attract enterprise clients.

## 🧪 Example Labs
📂 **Lab 1: ISO 27001 Core Controls**  
- Review Annex A of ISO 27001.  
- Map 3 relevant controls to SaaS startup `xxxx` (e.g., Access Control, Supplier Security, Backup & Recovery).  

📂 **Lab 2: NIST CSF Functions**  
- Map NIST CSF’s five functions to SaaS startup operations.  
- Example: *Identify* → Asset Inventory of cloud servers, *Protect* → MFA for all employees.  

📂 **Lab 3: Framework Comparison Matrix**  
- Create a simple table comparing ISO 27001 vs. NIST CSF.  
- Highlight one benefit and one limitation of each for a SaaS startup.  

📂 **Lab 4: Business Case**  
- Draft a one-page justification: *Why should `xxxx` adopt ISO 27001 or NIST CSF?*  

---

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding and applying **compliance frameworks**.  
- Performing a **framework mapping exercise**.  
- Building a **business justification** for GRC adoption.  
- Translating technical frameworks into business value.  

---

## 🏢 Case Study – SaaS Startup `xxxx`
- The startup’s new **enterprise customer** requires proof of **ISO 27001 certification** or an equivalent framework.  
- The leadership team must decide whether to invest in **ISO 27001** or align with **NIST CSF** as a first step.  
- Limited budget means the company needs a **clear business case** before committing.
