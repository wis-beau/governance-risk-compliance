Welcome to Section 15 of the **Cybersecurity Course Labs** repo.  
This section explores **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** with a practical case study of a fictional SaaS startup (`xxxx`) as it begins its GRC journey.

## üè¢ Case Study ‚Äì SaaS Startup (`xxxx`)
To make concepts practical, we will use the case of a **fictional SaaS startup** that offers a **cloud-based collaboration and AI productivity platform**.  

The startup is at the stage where:
- Enterprise clients demand **ISO 27001 or SOC 2 certification**.  
- The company must establish **governance, risk, and compliance processes** to scale securely.  
- A small security team needs to **balance compliance requirements with limited resources**.  

We will apply GRC concepts to this SaaS startup throughout the modules.
